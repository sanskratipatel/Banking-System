# JDBC Banking System Project

This project implements a basic banking system using Java with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database operations. It includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing bank accounts.

## Project Overview

The JDBC Banking System allows users to perform the following operations:
- **Create**: Open new bank accounts.
- **Read**: Display account details and transaction history.
